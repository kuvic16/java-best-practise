# Using naming conventions

### Self-explanatory

A name must reveal its intention so everyone can understand and change the code easily. For example, the names
"d" or "str" do not reveal anything; however the names "daysToExpire" or "inputText" do reveal their intention clearly. Note that, if a name
requires a comment to describe itself, then the name is not self-explanatory.
