# Using naming conventions

### Self-explanatory

A name must reveal its intention so everyone can understand and change the code easily. For example, the names
"d" or "str" do not reveal anything; however the names "daysToExpire" or "inputText" do reveal their intention clearly. Note that, if a name
requires a comment to describe itself, then the name is not self-explanatory.

### Meaningful distinction

If names must be different, then they should also mean something different. For example, the names "a1" and "a2" are meaningless distinction; and the names "source" and "destination" are meaningful distinction.

### Pronounceable

Names should be pronounceable as naturally as spoken language because we are humans - very good at words.
For example, which name can you pronounce and remember easily: "genStamp" or "generationTimestamp"?

- Class and interface names should be nouns, starting with an uppercase letter. Student, Car, Rectangle, Painter etc
- Variable names should be verbs, starting with a lowercase letter. run, start, stop, execute etc.
- Constant names should have all UPPERCASE letters and words are separated by underscores. MAX_SIZE, MIN_WIDTH, MIN_HEIGHT
- Using camelCase notation for names. StudentManager, CarController, numberOfStudents, runAnalysis etc.
